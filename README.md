Hi, I am interested in this job

I will just write down short list of visualizations & calculations I have done in the past to represent myself

1.  https://s.codepen.io/bumbeishvili/debug/YpKzBV  - this chart visualizes employees competency and behavior scores

2. https://s.codepen.io/bumbeishvili/debug/yayErR  - this chart visualizes employee hierarchy inside company

3. https://s.codepen.io/bumbeishvili/debug/LROkRo -  this chart compares election and exit poll results

Small projects which are somewhat relative this job : 

1.  http://s.codepen.io/bumbeishvili/debug/wMmYWr  - related with circle & slider 
2. http://s.codepen.io/bumbeishvili/debug/wMyxXB   - related with calculations


 I have read project description, and have one question :

According to example, you have linked, down payment % is static number, so I don't understand how it affects  on  years and down payment's worth value ?

 I hope we will work together in the future
