1. I allowed user to zoom out  

2. I have added image on square 

3. I also have implemented to show logged user in a tree 

4. I have added tooltip  Here is result   http://s.codepen.io/bumbeishvili/debug/rLkjVw  

 Of course it's ugly yet, but it will be more beautiful after I will work on it.  If you are interested , you can view my personal web page to get more info about me  http://bumbeishvili.github.io/

### 2.[Custom high performance charts/data visualization for 100 000/1 000 000+ datapoints](https://www.upwork.com/jobs/~011309e7bc70717524)
 ```
 Hi, I am interested in your project  
 
 Currently I am working as junior asp.net developer in bank of Georgia (Georgia is country) , I work on data visualization projects on upwork as well. 
  So I look as I am naturally fitted with this project :$  
  
  You can get more info on my personal website - bumbeishvili.github.io  
  
  About that project and related experience: I have developed several d3.js based charts  Some of them, which use thousands of datasets are:  
  
  1. https://s.codepen.io/bumbeishvili/debug/yayErR - Employees Hierarchy chart It uses 1500 employees datapoints and works without performance problems  
  
  2. http://s.codepen.io/bumbeishvili/debug/reqPav - Average Temperature Heatmap it uses 3000 datapoints and also works without performance problems  
  
  3. http://s.codepen.io/bumbeishvili/debug/vKYygY - Meteorite Strikes (relatively old project) it uses 1000 datapoints  
  
  First of all ,I need current underperforming chart screenshots, to detect what type of charts you want, Then we can agree other terms, if you decide to hire me.  
  
  Looking forward to hearing back from you and hope we can work together

# Interviewed

1. [Create visualizations based on d3](https://www.upwork.com/jobs/Create-visualizations-based_~01930d42ec7cc29d9c)
```
Hi, I am interested in this job, it seems challenging job and will be good additions for my portfolio  

I have looked into designs :   

  Most challenging part seems shadows and gradients over the charts ... everything else seems pretty trivial  
  
  These are d3 projects I have done in the past:  
  1. https://s.codepen.io/bumbeishvili/debug/YpKzBV - this chart visualizes 360 assessment scores for one employee  
  
  2. https://s.codepen.io/bumbeishvili/debug/WGkxKy - this is custom designed chart, it uses same technique for shadows (filtering), that must be applied charts in your design (sectors are clickable)  
  
  3. https://s.codepen.io/bumbeishvili/debug/RGbvPg - this is simple line and pie chart example, purpose of this project, is to mimic chart.js basic graphs  
  
  
  I have also created more d3.js charts, , not everyone is relevant for this project, but I will list them anyway: 
  
  1. https://s.codepen.io/bumbeishvili/debug/LROkRo - visualizes exit polls results, and shows differences with real data 
  
  2. https://s.codepen.io/bumbeishvili/debug/yayErR - organization chart  
  
  3. https://github.com/bumbeishvili/free-code-camp-projects - here ,in data visualization section, are my old projects   
  
  if you want to know more, about me and my projects , please, take a look on my personal website   
  https://bumbeishvili.github.io  
  
  
  I am using git for source control , and trello for issue tracking & management .   
  
  
  Hope we will have long term relationship :)  
  
  Best regards

1. [Implement graphs with forecasting using D3.js](https://www.upwork.com/jobs/~01fffb49a32d4b9539)
```
Hi, I am interested in this job, it seems challenging and these charts will be good additions for my portfolio 

I have looked into designs : 

As I see, all charts have same layout and there are only five different paths , with different tooltips , that's good because I can apply same technique for all types charts ...

If you decide to hire me for this project, I will be available 20 hours in a week and can start working from Friday ...

Hi, I am interested in this job, it seems challenging and this network graph  will be good addition for my upwork portfolio 

So, my opinions and questions about the features :

1. collision detection - based on example, you have linked, I don't think it will be hard to implement this


2. collapsible children nodes - as I see from example, collapsibility is implemented same way , in different d3.js examples  .   
    I have implemented this feature, past, in the organization chart (https://s.codepen.io/bumbeishvili/debug/yayErR  )
so, I think It will not be hard to implement  this feature here either

3. so, by toggles you mean when user clicks node, it collapses, and when user clicks again same node, it will expand neighbors, right? 

4. In this step, you only want to attach these callbacks to the on click, dblclick, and mouseover events? 

5. I haven't tried this in the past  , so , some research would be needed in that step

6. as I understand you want simple tooltip, which shows "hover_text" text on mouse over , but what you mean by "change back to 'name' on mouseout"? what is name variable here? 

7. This attribute changing is easy, but when size grows, then nodes must arranged to adapt new size, so , here  would also be needed research 




I will list my past projects, for your information about my experience:

1. https://s.codepen.io/bumbeishvili/debug/YpKzBV - this chart visualizes 360 assessment scores for one employee 

2. https://s.codepen.io/bumbeishvili/debug/WGkxKy - this is custom designed chart (sectors are clickable) , with advanced interactivity

3. https://bumbeishvili.github.io/chartjs-to-d3js/-  purpose of this project, is to mimic chart.js basic graphs 

4. https://s.codepen.io/bumbeishvili/debug/LROkRo - visualizes exit polls results, and shows differences with real data 

5. https://s.codepen.io/bumbeishvili/debug/yayErR - organization chart  

6 . https://github.com/bumbeishvili/free-code-camp-projects - here ,in data visualization section, are my old projects 


if you want to know more, about me and my projects , please, take a look on my personal website 

https://bumbeishvili.github.io 




I am using git for source control 

private github repository for development (I will give you dev access, if you have account) 

issues for task and progress management

github pages for displaying up to date results  (for example, this is one of my ongoing projects live preview - https://bumbeishvili.github.io/simple-dashboard-reports/nestedPie/nestedPie.html)

One question :  What is deadline for this project?

I can start working from Thursday and can work  max 20-30 h  in a week ...

I hope we will have long term relationship :) 

Best regards 

Dato B
