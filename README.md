Hi, I have seen your job and I liked it. So , I tried to implement your requests and modified your jsfiddle chart  

1. I allowed user to zoom out  

2. I have added image on square 

3. I also have implemented to show logged user in a tree 

4. I have added tooltip  Here is result   http://s.codepen.io/bumbeishvili/debug/rLkjVw  

 Of course it's ugly yet, but it will be more beautiful after I will work on it.  If you are interested , you can view my personal web page to get more info about me  http://bumbeishvili.github.io/

**status: nothing**
```
Hi, I am interested in this job

I will just write down short list of visualizations & calculations I have done in the past to represent myself

1.  https://s.codepen.io/bumbeishvili/debug/YpKzBV  - this chart visualizes employees competency and behavior scores

2. https://s.codepen.io/bumbeishvili/debug/yayErR  - this chart visualizes employee hierarchy inside company

3. https://s.codepen.io/bumbeishvili/debug/LROkRo -  this chart compares election and exit poll results

Small projects which are somewhat relative this job : 

1.  http://s.codepen.io/bumbeishvili/debug/wMmYWr  - related with circle & slider 
2. http://s.codepen.io/bumbeishvili/debug/wMyxXB   - related with calculations


 I have read project description, and have one question :

According to example, you have linked, down payment % is static number, so I don't understand how it affects  on  years and down payment's worth value ?

 I hope we will work together in the future

improvements
```
I would be use, select2(which has search feature) instead of default html select for city selector and would be fill it with more data 

Also I don't like colorized worth value squares . I think semantic ui's statistic view would be good , specifically the one with airplane icon
```
deliver
```
If I will start tomorrow (23 November morning) ,  I will deliver it in same day (23  November night ), otherwise in 3-4 days. 
```
what is this
```
You are trying to help people (which want to buy a house) to analyze their finance, saving  and make optimal decision .

House worth value calculation (if this square item prices are local) is for calculating real value and also for fun
```
