Hi, I have seen your job and I liked it. So , I tried to implement your requests and modified your jsfiddle chart  

1. I allowed user to zoom out  

2. I have added image on square 

3. I also have implemented to show logged user in a tree 

4. I have added tooltip  Here is result   http://s.codepen.io/bumbeishvili/debug/rLkjVw  

 Of course it's ugly yet, but it will be more beautiful after I will work on it.  If you are interested , you can view my personal web page to get more info about me  http://bumbeishvili.github.io/

 Hi, I am interested in your project  
 
 Currently I am working as junior asp.net developer in bank of Georgia (Georgia is country) , I work on data visualization projects on upwork as well. 
  So I look as I am naturally fitted with this project :$

  About that project and related experience: I have developed several d3.js based charts  Some of them, which use thousands of datasets are:  
  
  1. https://s.codepen.io/bumbeishvili/debug/yayErR - Employees Hierarchy chart It uses 1500 employees datapoints and works without performance problems  
  
  2. http://s.codepen.io/bumbeishvili/debug/reqPav - Average Temperature Heatmap it uses 3000 datapoints and also works without performance problems  
  
  3. http://s.codepen.io/bumbeishvili/debug/vKYygY - Meteorite Strikes (relatively old project) it uses 1000 datapoints  
  
  First of all ,I need current underperforming chart screenshots, to detect what type of charts you want, Then we can agree other terms, if you decide to hire me.  
  
  Looking forward to hearing back from you and hope we can work together

# Interviewed

1. [Create visualizations based on d3](https://www.upwork.com/jobs/Create-visualizations-based_~01930d42ec7cc29d9c)
```
Hi, I am interested in this job, it seems challenging job and will be good additions for my portfolio  

I have looked into designs :   

  Most challenging part seems shadows and gradients over the charts ... everything else seems pretty trivial  
  
  These are d3 projects I have done in the past:  
  1. https://s.codepen.io/bumbeishvili/debug/YpKzBV - this chart visualizes 360 assessment scores for one employee  
  
  2. https://s.codepen.io/bumbeishvili/debug/WGkxKy - this is custom designed chart, it uses same technique for shadows (filtering), that must be applied charts in your design (sectors are clickable)  
  
  3. https://s.codepen.io/bumbeishvili/debug/RGbvPg - this is simple line and pie chart example, purpose of this project, is to mimic chart.js basic graphs  
  
  
  I have also created more d3.js charts, , not everyone is relevant for this project, but I will list them anyway: 
  
  1. https://s.codepen.io/bumbeishvili/debug/LROkRo - visualizes exit polls results, and shows differences with real data 
  
  2. https://s.codepen.io/bumbeishvili/debug/yayErR - organization chart  
  
  3. https://github.com/bumbeishvili/free-code-camp-projects - here ,in data visualization section, are my old projects   
  
  if you want to know more, about me and my projects , please, take a look on my personal website   
  https://bumbeishvili.github.io  
  
  
  I am using git for source control , and trello for issue tracking & management .   
  
  
  Hope we will have long term relationship :)  
  
  Best regards 
  
  Dato B.
